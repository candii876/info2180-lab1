            <h2> Candice Giselle Beckford</h2>
            <p> Veterinarian at heart, Computer Science student by profession. 
                Lover of languages, cultures and adventures.
                My favorite quote is "If you can't feed 100 persons, feed just 1." 
                I love to learn new things and also to share knowledge.
                I love a challenge, am very hardworking and work well with teams. 
                Web Design has always been a personal interest of mine, then one day the thought occured to me, 
                "If you're gonna spend all day on something, you might as well generate income from it",
                and so my education in web development began.
